# Project--Hadoop-35

<table>
  
**In this project We will use MapReduce with Python to do an amazing stuff.Here We will calculate total count of each words in Book.txt file.** <br></br>

Here will use combiners in addition to mapper and reducer to do some reducing job in mapper node itself before giving the jobs to reducer.
Both Mapper and Reducer will have the same output and input. It just decreases the network traffic in our cluster.

**Before jumping to the code lets understand MapReduce First**...<br></br>

MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that Hadoop programs perform.
A MapReduce program is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting, and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation.


**Important Note: Go through the Book.txt file before jumping to the code.**
